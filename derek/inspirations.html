	<h2><span class="firstwords">Ralph Waldo Emerson</span> once said that "Great men are they who see that spiritual is stronger than any material force - that thoughts rule the world."</h2>

	<h3>Here are some great men who have inspired me:</h3>

	<h3 class="firstwords">Kanye West</h2>
	<img src="kanye.jpeg" alt="Yeezus">
	<p>Kanye is a poet -- a true Shakespeare of our era -- and he truly understands that thoughts rule the world. He uses his words to educate and inspire, and does not hesitate to express himself.</p>

	<h3 class="firstwords">Samuel L Jackson in Pulp Fiction</h3>
	<img src="sam jackson.png" alt="refreshing">
	<p>Samuel L as Jules Winnfield embodies a genuine redemption story. He, like Emerson, embraces the spiritual world, as he resigns from his occupation as a gangster to <del>be a bum</del> walk the earth, after witnessing divine intervention. He is also highly charismatic, as people he just met readily share their cheeseburgers and soda with him.</p>

	<h3 class="firstwords">Samwise Gamgee</h3>
	<img src ="sam g.jpg" alt="Samwise">
	<p>Sam, sometimes called "the fat one," is an unsung, often overlooked hero of The Lord of the Rings. He took care of Frodo and protected him throughout his journey, supporting his friend throughout their quest. He was also a passionate chef, finding time to cook stews while surrounded by enemies.</p>
